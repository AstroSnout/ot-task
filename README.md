# Ethereum blockchain crawler
Simple Ethereum blockchain scraper with a simple front-end to show the data.  
  
The project is comprised of two separate apps - API server (Python) and Front-end website (React).  
  
Instructions on how to run both of the apps are located in the README files in their respective folders.  
  
If you plan on running both locally, keep in mind that CORS is a thing, so you would need to open the front-end app in a [browser that is running without CORS](https://alfilatov.com/posts/run-chrome-without-cors/). Otherwise, the front-end app will not be able to send API requests to the API server app.
